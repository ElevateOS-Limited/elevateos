Codex review rules and execution invariants for **ElevateOS Demo**

This repository uses a strict control loop defined in `MASTER_TASK_BOARD.md`.  
All pull requests must be evaluated against the system invariants below.

Reviewers must prioritize **data correctness, tenant isolation, and end-to-end flow integrity** over stylistic concerns.

---

# 1. Core principle

This repo is developed through **stitched vertical slices**.

A PR should:
- complete a defined slice from `MASTER_TASK_BOARD`
- preserve tenant isolation
- preserve RBAC enforcement
- preserve working build state

A PR should **never**:
- introduce new surface area before previous slice wiring is complete
- weaken tenant isolation or role enforcement
- introduce placeholder logic

---

# 2. Hard blockers (automatic review failure)

Reject PR if ANY of the following appear.

## Tenant isolation violation
All tenant data must be scoped by `orgId`.

Required rules:
- Prisma queries must include `orgId` filter
- API routes must derive orgId from session
- orgId must never be accepted directly from client

Violations:
- `findMany()` or `update()` without org filter
- trusting client orgId

---

## RBAC enforcement missing
All write routes must enforce roles.

Roles defined in:
src/lib/auth/roles.ts


Server must enforce:
- owner
- admin
- tutor
- parent
- student

UI gating alone is **not sufficient**.

Example violation:


if (session.user.role === "tutor") { ... }


without server validation.

---

## Placeholder logic shipped
Reject if any of these appear:


TODO
FIXME
placeholder
lorem
mock data in production path


Demo mode flags are allowed only if they **do not bypass RBAC or tenant scoping**.

---

## Broken control loop
Reject PR if:

- `MASTER_TASK_BOARD.md` updated incorrectly
- logging files removed
- commit bypasses defined slice sequencing

Required files:


MASTER_TASK_BOARD.md
PROGRESS_LOG.md
HEARTBEAT.md
POSTMORTEM.md


---

# 3. Funnel A invariants

Reference: Section 1 of `MASTER_TASK_BOARD.md`.

Minimum working flow must remain intact:

Tutor flow:


login
→ /dashboard/quickstart
→ select class + student
→ generate worksheet
→ assign
→ record score
→ generate monthly report
→ review history


Reviewers must verify that the PR does not break this path.

---

## Funnel A entity model

Required entities for completion:


Organization
Class
Student
Assessment
Attempt
LessonPlan
LessonSession
CalendarEvent
Report
Document


Reject PR if schema changes break compatibility.

---

## Funnel A critical routes

Routes must enforce:

- RBAC
- orgId scoping
- validation

Critical endpoints:


/api/worksheets/generate
/api/worksheets
/api/feedback
/api/notes
/api/classes/*
/api/students/*
/api/assessments/*
/api/reports/monthly/*


---

# 4. AI Integrity module invariants

Reference: Section 2 of `MASTER_TASK_BOARD.md`.

Pipeline must follow:


Upload
→ Extract text
→ Segment
→ Score
→ Highlight
→ Export
→ Persist job
→ Link to student profile


Reject PR if any step is skipped.

---

## Required database entities


AiDetectionJob
AiDetectionSegment
AiDetectionReport


Each job must include:


jobId
studentId
documentId
status
createdAt


Segments must include:


segmentText
score
label
confidence
rationale


---

## Idempotency requirement

Running analysis twice must **not duplicate segments or reports**.

Job reruns should update existing records.

Reject PR if duplicate rows are possible.

---

# 5. Export requirements

Exports must include:


PDF
DOCX


Exports must contain:

- title
- student
- date
- overall score
- segment breakdown
- disclaimer

Reject PR if export produces empty file or placeholder content.

---

# 6. Logging protocol

Each commit cycle must update:


PROGRESS_LOG.md
HEARTBEAT.md
POSTMORTEM.md


Heartbeat cadence:


30 minute status
60 minute commit or postmortem


Reject PR if logs are removed or bypassed.

---

# 7. Code quality expectations

Prefer:

- shared utilities
- small composable functions
- typed inputs
- consistent error responses

Avoid:

- magic constants
- duplicated logic
- hidden side effects

---

# 8. Tooling expectations

The following must remain functional:


npm run build


Lint/test scripts may fail temporarily (known baseline issue) but **must not regress further**.

Known baseline issues:


Next lint config mismatch
missing typecheck script
missing test script


---

# 9. What approval means

Approve only if:

1. RBAC is enforced server-side
2. orgId isolation is correct
3. vertical slice remains functional
4. no placeholders exist
5. database writes are deterministic
6. build succeeds

If any invariant is uncertain, request changes.

---

# 10. Review philosophy

Codex should review with the mindset:

**This is a multi-tenant SaaS.**

Primary risks are:

- tenant data leakage
- role privilege escalation
- broken end-to-end product flow

Focus on those first.
